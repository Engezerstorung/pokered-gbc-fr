To Import save across patched and unpatched versions : 
- Save at the entrance of an interior (like a pokécenter) as of not having to move a block to go out
- Import save in new version
- Load save, press down to exit the building
- Profit


My process to make this have been to compare the color patched version and the english unpatched version to spot the differences and paste them in the french version while keeping the differences specific to this disassembly project. (while also doing some  manual adjustments to some graphical text stuff)

Made using those sources :

- Full color patch for pokémon red by FroggestSpirit, Drenn, and dannye : https://github.com/dannye/pokered-gbc .
- French disassembly : https://github.com/einstein95/pokered-fr
